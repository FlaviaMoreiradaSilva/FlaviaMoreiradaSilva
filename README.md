Hi!!!

I'm Flávia, a Computer Science Education student at UTFPR, passionate about technology, programming, and the world of Tolkien 🌿. Here you'll find my projects, studies, and experiments with languages like Python, C, Java, and more.

In my free time, I'm a Valorant player for the UTFPR university team Azure Bears 🎮 and the proud mommy of a little cat named Goku 🐾.
I'm always learning, growing, and sharing a bit of my journey here.
